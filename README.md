# Pulsar Timing Environments

This repository offers a centeralized location for the IPTA Pulsar Timing & Data Combination Teams' environment.

## Important Note Regarding Included OpenMPI
For Linux 64, Open MPI is built with CUDA awareness but this support is disabled by default. To enable it, please set the environment variable `OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support=true` before launching your MPI processes. Equivalently, you can set the MCA parameter in the command line:

`mpiexec --mca opal_cuda_support 1 ...`
 
In addition, the UCX support is also built but disabled by default. To enable it, first install UCX (`conda install -c conda-forge ucx`). Then, set the environment variables `OMPI_MCA_pml="ucx"` and `OMPI_MCA_osc="ucx"` before launching your MPI processes. Equivalently, you can set the MCA parameters in the command line:

`mpiexec --mca pml ucx --mca osc ucx ...`

Note that you might also need to set `UCX_MEMTYPE_CACHE=n` for CUDA awareness via UCX. Please consult UCX's documentation for detail.
